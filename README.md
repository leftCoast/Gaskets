# Gaskets
I'd like a place to store gasket drawings.

Here's the plan.

I figured every gasket was designed by someone. Probably some company. So, lets sort these first level by the company that designed/owned them. From there the folders can be sorted in whatever order that makes the most sense. Now, by what I mean as the company that designed/owned them. I don't mean where you find them, but who actually would be the orignator of them. For example: Doing a carburator gasket for a vehicle. Its NOT the vehicle company name you would file it under, but the name of the company that designed/built that carburator.

How will this work out?

We'll see..
